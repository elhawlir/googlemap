# googlemap
This is a GeoJSON project

This project can do a brand or a category nearby search for specific locations, and get the data into an excel document as tabular format. For example, you want to know how many fast-food restaurants (includes addresses) within 5 miles of Ivy League schools.

Make sure you have already registered your Google Map API first.
